To add AI functionality here are the steps that should be followed.

	1) Create a unit test for an action. The action will dictate how the AI will accomplish the task

	2) Create the action class. It should inherit from Action and contain everything necessary to accomplish
       the task.

	3) Create the event class. It should inherit from BaseEvent. This event should only be used to transfer 
       information and should not modify it in any way. It should only caontain elements that are absolutely
       necessary.

	4) Add the functionality to the AI. The AI should take the event and then call the actionable. The actionable should be
       added to the queue in the AI to be completed in the FIFO ordering.

	5) Add the ability for the EntityEventHandler to pass along this new event
